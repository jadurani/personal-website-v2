                  I received an invitation to work on this project via LinkedIn.

                  needed a skilled designer and developer to build a new website
                  for a construction company in the Philippines.

                The first version of the website was built 10 years ago. This
                was what they had prior to the revamp:

                , it was clear to me that they needed a simple but
                modern-looking website that highlights their own magic. Having
                too much ‚Äúfluff‚Äù on their website might compete with the primary
                objective of actually showcasing the company&#39;s work.

              <p className="py-2.5 text-justify text-tuna/60">
                The client had a new logo coming up with the website revamp and
                they had another contractor working on it. While waiting for the
                final logo, I worked on drawing the wireframes based on the
                outline they have given to me in one of our initial meetings.

              <p className="py-2.5 text-justify text-tuna/60">
                Upon receiving the updated logo, I decided on the colors and
                fonts that we&#39;ll use for the website and started working on
                the designs in Figma. Whenever I created a draft of a page, I
                sent my client the link to my interactive mock-up and request
                for comments.

                Although building the designs was a breeze, we encountered a few
                challenges in the website development and deployments, having
                multiple missing or misconfigured records and no one knows who
                has access to what anymore and there were no documentations on
                them either üòÖ
              </p>
              <p className="py-2.5 text-justify text-tuna/60">
                I won&#39;t go over the details of the complexities here for
                privacy reasons, but to summarize, I went ahead and investigated
                the current state of the system, contacted the support teams of
                the external parties and previous vendors involved, laid out the
                problems to the client, and suggested possible approaches to
                deal with the said complexities, each with pros and cons and
                estimated costs.
              </p>
              <p className="py-2.5 text-justify text-tuna/60">
                Once the client made the decision on which approach to take, I
                proceeded with the development and deployment.

              <p className="py-2.5 text-justify text-tuna/60">
                We closed the project with me handing over documentation on
                their system detailing the roadblocks we&#39;ve encountered and
                the decisions made in relation to them. To top it off, I held a
                training session with their staff to help them make some small
                updates in the contents of the website.
